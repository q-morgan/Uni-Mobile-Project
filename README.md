# Uni-Mobile-Project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a project created for a 3rd year Computer Science module at UWE. The app is designed to test your knowledge of monkey species by presenting pictures and challenging you to guess the correct species. During this module, we had to learn the programming language, Swift, and create an mobile app. The App was developed with the aim of promoting education and entertainment by providing an interactive platform for users to learn about various monkey species.
